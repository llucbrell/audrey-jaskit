## Format actions

audrey-jaskit as jaskit module, give you the chance of preformat the answers before it'll be writted on the file. This could be usefull for making JSON files or other staff.

Every answer is writted on a different line so you can add things, before the user text, after or replace things on the user text.

Example

```js
var arrayOfFormatObjects=[{
    question: 1, // number of question you want to format in stdrd array numeration
    before: "{", //add something before user answer
    after: " }", //"     "         after  "     "
    replace: /fine/, //regular expresion to find and replace with
    put: "Ok.." //the text inserted instead of regular expresion match
}]
```
## Remember

Use the x as first character of the taggy.
